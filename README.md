# VOSH


- I want a cool galaxy map for my players to be able to view active quests, track resources, and view information about their fledgeling rebel cell
    - Why?
    - I like having things spread out on a map -- it can be inspiring to my planning phases
    - I think it's cool to have some living document in the wild for players to look at between sessions and keep the game alive during the week
    - I can show the scale of the Empire much easier if they can track progress
    - I think it would be fun to code a simple civ-style simulation of a Star Wars galaxy

- MVP
    - Star map, with a base and a planet, and a credit value. (EMPIRE AT WAR)
    - Exclamation marks over possible quest hooks (BASIC RPG GRAPHICS)
    - Big wiki of stuff, links prevalent and nice. (EASY TO NAVIGATE)

REMINDER: Don't look into stateful stuff or any of the other pipe dream features untile the MVP is done


- Pipe Dream Features
    - accept and train recruits (state + updates, more than just a static site)
    - manage funds, purchase goods + upgrades
    - organize teams and assign them to missions
    - view intel
    - automated shops + economy
    - puzzles + codes!
    - random encounter tables
    - complete character sheet overhaul
    - automated training course => random encounter auto-battle using character sheet
